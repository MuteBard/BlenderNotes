    By default, when you go ahead and you rotate an object, it will rotate around its origin
    The median point is the average point of all of these objects

    i couldnt screen shot everything but what i did was make the flattened cube much larger (10x) and then extruded the flattened cube and then joined some vertexs and then hollowed out the center, then added a new cube and flattened it and placed it in the center

    Then I put the 3d cursor on the edge and rotated along the y axis of the 3d cursor
